# Simulating Ethical Decision Making
The simulation of fuzzy reasoning ethical rules for drones.

This project was a part of my master thesis [Simulating Ethical Decision Making in drones](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352001364_Simulating_Ethical_Decision-Making_in_Multi-Agent_Systems). The simulation is written in NetLogo language using fuzzy reasoning support in Java. The theory and model description, as well as the implementation and evaluation, can be found in the thesis.
